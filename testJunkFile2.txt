This is a test file. 
Included content is some random text.
The purpose is for practicing and experimenting with Vim and Git.
Here is the next line of text:
Line number five of text.
Line number six of text.
Line number seven of text.






Now I will try to save the file 
with the following command:
" :q! "
Well that turned out to be WRONG!
So I used the statement:
" :wq " and that seemed to work.
Actually this is not correct.
I used the longer statement:
"  :wq testJunkFile2.txt   "
That appears to save the file 
with the latest changes that
I made to the file.
